# Extended-CHP
Complement to the original CHP algorithm [Phys. Rev. A 70, 052328 (2004)] for a complete simulation of fault-tolerant quantum protocols that include repetitive preparation and measurement of qubits that is, reusing the qubits.
Therefore, this work takes a zero matrix as an initial tableau instead of the identity matrix, and defines the definite actions for the preparation on a computational basis.
